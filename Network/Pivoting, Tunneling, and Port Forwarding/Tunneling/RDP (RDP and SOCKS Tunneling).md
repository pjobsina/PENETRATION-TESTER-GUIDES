- [SocksOverRDP](https://github.com/nccgroup/SocksOverRDP) is an example of a tool that uses `Dynamic Virtual Channels` (`DVC`) from the Remote Desktop Service feature of Windows. 
- DVC is responsible for tunneling packets over the RDP connection.
We will need:
1. [SocksOverRDP x64 Binaries](https://github.com/nccgroup/SocksOverRDP/releases)
2. [Proxifier Portable Binary](https://www.proxifier.com/download/#win-tab)
3. We can look for `ProxifierPE.zip`
We can then connect to the target using xfreerdp and copy the `SocksOverRDPx64.zip` file to the target. From the Windows target, we will then need to load the SocksOverRDP.dll using regsvr32.exe.
#### regsvr32.exe
```cmd
regsvr32.exe SocksOverRDP-Plugin.dll
```
Now we can connect to 172.16.5.19 over RDP using `mstsc.exe`, and we should receive a prompt that the SocksOverRDP plugin is enabled, and it will listen on 127.0.0.1:1080. We can use the credentials `victor:pass@123` to connect to 172.16.5.19.

We will need to transfer SocksOverRDPx64.zip or just the SocksOverRDP-Server.exe to 172.16.5.19. We can then start SocksOverRDP-Server.exe with Admin privileges.
#### Confirming the SOCKS Listener is Started
```cmd
netstat -antb | findstr 1080
```
- When we go back to our foothold target and check with Netstat, we should see our SOCKS listener started on 127.0.0.1:1080.
After starting our listener, we can transfer Proxifier portable to the Windows 10 target (on the 10.129.x.x network), and configure it to forward all our packets to 127.0.0.1:1080. Proxifier will route traffic through the given host and port. See the clip below for a quick walkthrough of configuring Proxifier.

With Proxifier configured and running, we can start mstsc.exe, and it will use Proxifier to pivot all our traffic via 127.0.0.1:1080, which will tunnel it over RDP to 172.16.5.19, which will then route it to 172.16.6.155 using SocksOverRDP-server.exe.
